# Roadmap

Interested how will the SSI Snap evolve in the future?

Planned features:

- Creation of new DIDs stored in the MetaMask.
- Additional ways of storing DIDs and VCs (Cloud, dropbox, etc.).
- Ability to sync data between multiple MetaMask wallets.
- UI elements inside MetaMask (depends on when MetaMask enables creation of custom UI).

Potential features:

- Support for other DID methods.
