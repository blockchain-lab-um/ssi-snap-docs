MetaMask is a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, providing a simple interface for users to interact with EVM-based blockchains, sign and send transactions, etc. Snaps thus make a wide specter of new applications possible. They can enable support for previously unsupported chains like Polkadot, Solana, Bitcoin, etc. They also provide additional local storage for dApps to store and retrieve data and allow access to the web with the possibility to leverage practically any API and much more. The creativity of developers only limits new functionality.
